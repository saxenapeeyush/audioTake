Currently the time taken between the recording of the audio is <strong>5 seconds</strong> which is equivalent to <strong>5000</strong>.
So if you have to increase or decrease the time , you can do it by changing the value of key in <strong>config.js (timeDelay)</strong> 

Suppose if you want to make it <strong>10 seconds then put 10000</strong> .

If you have to change the file type then also you have to refer to config.js file .

When the Start Recording button is pressed then it will be <strong>disable after the click</strong> so that the <strong>user won't be able to change the current recording </strong>.

To restart a new recording , you will press reset button .

While reloading the page the reset button will be disable because <strong>currently no audio has been recorded</strong> , but when the start recording button is pressed then the <strong>button will be enabled to reset the voice once again</strong> .
